## Blodholmen 

This project was created as a group assignment for "Sammanslaget". Over the course of four days, students from Yrgos programs in Web Development, UX Design, and Screenwriting came together to create this application.

The tools used in this project are Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase Realtime.

## Introduction

Blodholmen was created with the goal of designing an interactive experience in the physical space at Lindholmen that users can engage with using a web application on their smartphones. Through missions, physical activation, and a bit of role-playing, we created a multiplayer game where users can explore the Lindholmen district.

Wanna play?  
Just bring a group of friends and head to Lindholmen, go to [Blodholmen](https://blodholmen.vercel.app/), create your room and press "Start Game" â€” but hey, watch out for the blood moon...

## Installation


```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Due to the short timeframe, the site is built solely for mobile devices. It will function, but it may not look very polished.
